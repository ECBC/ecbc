## Hello there 👋

###

My name is Enrique Cortina and I'm an Analytics Engineer from Spain.

I daily use Python and SQL for my data magic tricks and find answers to business questions.
###

- ✨ Fixing bugs since 2012  
  Started working at a bank in 2012 and learnt "You Can't Manage What You Can't Measure".  
  Lucky to find in programming an oportunity to simplify repetitive tasks, and to solve complex problems.  
- 🔭 I’m currently working as Data Manager for one of the biggest retailers in the world.  
  Lead the team of data analysts and data scientists in a 10B€ division inside the company.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply secure and efficient Machine Learning and AI solutions.  
  Love statistics and math but also curious about all sciences. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data projects to have an impact in the world.  
  Enjoy a lot seeing how my efforts solve real life problems.
- 💬 Ask me about data, specially with Python and SQL.  
  Always happy to share knowledge. I found out the more I share the more We learn.
